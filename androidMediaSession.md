#Android MediaSession
MediaSessions control various things in regard to playback for an application. It hanles media button inputs from various sources like headphones, transports, and google assistant. It also allows you to show the lockscreen transport as far as I'm aware.

## How do I use it?
mediaSessions have to be initialized in the same activity or service with the mediaplayer.
