# Vox FM Radio

An application commissioned by an online radio Station [VoxFM](www.somosvoxfm.com).
The application was mainly built using React-Native, though native modules were also implemented using swift and java in order
to play the ShoutCast stream on the device, both actively and in the background.

Currently, the application is available on the app store [Vox FM Radio](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vox-fm-radio/id1374569104?ls=1&mt=8)
and will soon be up on the google play store
